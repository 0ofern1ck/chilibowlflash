Bloxorz running off of ruffle, on its very own webpage. Making it easy to embed right onto your website! May take a smidge to load. 

I do plan on adding more games on sperate pages so that I just have a collection, but for now, it's just bloxorz. This is different than the ¨pack¨ as this version is just each game on its own page, which makes it better for embeds.

Also, you don have to give credit if you iframe or embed this for your own website. I don´t care.
