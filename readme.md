Flash Games running off of ruffle, on their very own webpage. Making it easy to embed right onto your website! May take a smidge to load. 

This is different than the ¨pack¨ as this version is just each game on its own page, which makes it better for embeds.  Also, yeah I know it looks straight out of the late 90's but whatever. If the link attached is down, then I'm most likely updating it.
