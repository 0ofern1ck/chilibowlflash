Flash Games running off of ruffle, on their very own webpage. Making it easy to embed right onto your website! May take a smidge to load. 

I do plan on adding more games on sperate pages so that I just have a collection, but for now, it's just a few. This is different than the ¨pack¨ as this version is just each game on its own page, which makes it better for embeds. Also, yeah I know it looks straight out of the late 90's but whatever. If the link attached is down, then Im most likely updating it.
